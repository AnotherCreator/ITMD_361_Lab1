    <h1>About me: Josh Reginaldo</h1>
    <p>
        I am a 3rd year commuter transfer student coming in from Joliet Junior College. I am currently majoring in ITM
        with a focus in Software Development and a minor in Computer Science. <br> <br>

        Other than school, I work part-time as a computer lab assistant at the Naperville Public Library. I would say it
        was this job and my experiences assembling desktop pcs that I wanted to pursue the ITM major. <br>

        However, I hope to be a software developer as my main career path in the future with anything IT related as
        my backup. <br> <br>

        As of right now, I am familiar with the Java, Python, and C programming languages, so I am looking <br>
        forward to learning some web development as my other class (ITMD-321) has the possibility of combining
        databases, web development, and Java / Python.
