    <h1>About me: Josh Reginaldo</h1>
    <p>
        I am a 3rd year commuter transfer student coming in from Joliet Junior College. I am currently majoring in ITM
        with a focus in Software Development and a minor in Computer Science. <br> <br>
        Other than school, I work part-time as a computer lab assistant at the Naperville Public Library. I would say it
        was this job and my experiences assembling desktop pcs that I wanted to pursue the ITM major. <br>
        However, I hope to be a software developer as my main career path in the future with anything IT related as
        my backup.
